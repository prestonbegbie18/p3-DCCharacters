        <p>Backstory</p>
        <p class="backstory">
          Jason Todd was Batman's second Robin after Dick Grayson left to take on his
          own crime fighting persona of Nightwing. Jason grew up in a troubled neighborhood.
          Jason's step-mom, Catherine Todd, died of a drug overdose and his father, Willis Todd,
          was killed by Two-Face. This forced Jason into a life of crime just to survive. Batman
          came across Jason while he was stealing the tires off the Batmobile. Seeing potetial
          in Todd, he took him under his wing as his second Robin. Years later, Jason learned that
          his real mother, Sheila Haywood, was alive and was captured by the Joker. In an attempt
          to rescue her, Jason was caught by the Joker and tortured. As Batman arrived on scene, a
          bomb went off killing Todd and his mother. Years later, a new criminal arrived in Gotham
          calling himself the Red Hood. After Batman begun his investigation, he quickly learned that
          the Red Hood was none other than Jason Todd. Bruce learned that his apprentice was resureccted
          by Ra's Al Ghul. After many confrontations, Todd and Bruce made ammends and Todd was welcomed back
          into the Bat Family as Red Hood even though Bruce still disagreed with Jason's methods of using firearms
          and lethal force.
