        <p>
          When Kal-El was born, Krypton was in the middle of a civil war and the planet
          was on the verge of blowing up. Kal's father and mother got him off planet before
          the planet exploded. Kal's pod landed in Kansas, the Kent Farm. Martha and Jonathan Kent
          took Kal and named him Clark. Throughout his life till his adulthood, his powers began to
          manifest and Clark began to realize that he was something more than human. There were always
          incidents that Clark wanted to help stop, but that would put him and the others around him
          at risk. When he first became Superman, he took a job at The Daily Planet so he could be close
          to danger without anyone being suspicious. Superman has battled many foes and he remains to be one
          of the most powerful metahumans in the world.
