        <p>In this website, you will learn about a few of my favorite characters
          in the DC Universe. These characters I've known throughout various times
          in my life. Some when I was young and some when I was in my teens. For
          simplicity sake, I've chosen four such characters, but this could be expanded
          upon and more characters could be added.
        </p>

          Down below you will be given the option to type in a character and read
          about their backstory or you can have a random choice by hitting Random.
