        <p>Backstory</p>
        <p class="backstory">
          The Joker was always a character of mystery. No one knew his true identity or
          what his backstory is. In the comic, "The Killing Joke" his backstory is hinted at.
          In the comic, he was a failed comedian who had a wife. They were going to have a
          baby and didn't have enough money to support themselves and the child. The Joker's
          only hope was helping out a couple of criminals on a small job through ACE Chemicals.
          The day of the job, Joker learned that his wife died in an accident and tried to back out on
          the criminals, but that wasn't going to happen. Joker's job was to aid the criminals through
          the plant to a place they wanted to rob on the other side. Things didn't go as expexted and
          Batman showed up. Batman approached Joker, known then as the criminal Red Hood, and he slipped
          into a vat of chemicals that turned him into the clown prince of crime.
