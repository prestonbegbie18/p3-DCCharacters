        <p>Backstory</p>
        <p class="backstory">
          When he was 8 years old, Bruce Wayne witnessed his parents being murdered before
          his eyes. Since then, he vowed to take vengence against the criminal scum of Gotham.
          He went to study CSI in college and after that he trained in the mountains with monks
          and martial artists in all forms of combat. He worked his body and mind to peek perfection.
          He became vengence. He became the night. He became Batman.
